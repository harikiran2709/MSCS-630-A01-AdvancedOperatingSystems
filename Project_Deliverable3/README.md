# Deliverable 3: Memory Management and Process Synchronization

This shell simulates memory management using paging and page replacement algorithms (FIFO and LRU), and demonstrates process synchronization using semaphores with a classical Producer-Consumer problem.

## Files
- `shell_mem_sync.py`: Main shell with memory management and synchronization simulation.
- `README.md`: Instructions and explanations.

## How to Run
Run the shell with:

    python3 shell_mem_sync.py

Follow on-screen prompts to test memory management and synchronization features.
